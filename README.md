# markup
The remove html markup project for [Tests4Py](https://github.com/smythi93/Tests4Py).
The idea of this project comes from [Introduction to Debugging](https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Intro_Debugging.html)
and from [Statistical Debugging](https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/StatisticalDebugger.html) from 
[The Debugging Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/).
